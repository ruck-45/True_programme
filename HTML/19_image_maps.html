    <ul>
        <li>We use image mapping in this case.</li>
        <li>Method 1 :
            <ul>
                <li>create a &lt;map> tag and give it a name.</li> <br> <br>
                <li>inside the map tag, use &lt;area> tags and give shape and coords [coordinates] attribute to define your area of intrest, in herf attribute provide the hyperlink to the targated website.</li>
                <li>coordinates can be different for different shapes, e.g, for rectangle we just need to give two coordinates of its corners. For a circle we need to provide coordinate of its centre and provide its radius. And for a polygon we need to provide all necessery coordinates.</li> <br><br>
                <li>In &lt;img> tag we use an attribute usemap [provide the map name in it] to use the map we just defined. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Method 2 :
            <ul>
                <li>Search image map generator in google, it will autometically generate code according to your requests</li>
                <li>Just copy the code and paste in your html file.</li>
                <li>Make sure to resize the image to correct resolution as in your html page and then upload to the image map editor.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
