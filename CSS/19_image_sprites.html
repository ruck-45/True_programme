    <h1>Image Sprites</h1> <hr>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Image sprite is a large image containing a lot of individual tiny image.</li>
            <li>Image sprites are used when we have a lot of small images in website and for loading that many small website we will have to deal with a lot of requsts, which slows the overal loading time of the website</li>
            <li>Thus we use image sprite to load all the image as a single large image with a single request and then show individually</li>
            <li>image sprites are mainly used with "background-image property". </li>
            <li>Use "background-position" to specify position of the icon</li>

            <br> <br>

            NOTE : it is not advisable to use sprites for  all circumstances. Use it only when dealing with a large number of small images. If we start doing image sprites for large sized images, then it will make the whole sprite very big as a result it will take a lot of time to load that single sprite, thus it will not be helping us in terms of fast website loading. So use image sprites for small images only.
        </ul>

        Example : <br> <br>

        - This is the original image sprite. <br>
        - We must be aware of all the dimentions in which each image is starting so that we can show them as individual images when needed. 
        <br> <br>

        - Original sprite image.. <br>
        <img src="./images/10.png" alt="img_01">

        <br> <br>
        - images displayed individually from sprites..
        <div id="id_01"></div>
        <div id="id_02"></div>
        <div id="id_03"></div>
