-- Theory : 
-- SQL is based on keywords like SELECT, CREATE, FROM ,WHERE etc..
-- These keywords are not case sensitive , i.e, we can write them however we want : Select , SELECT ,SeLeCt etc.
-- But is is best practice to write keywords in UPPER CASE only : SELECT , to distinguish it from others as they will be in lower case

 -- A Database is a collection of tables
 -- If the tables have relation with each other then it is called Relational Database
 
 -- Creating a Database
 CREATE DATABASE test;
 
 -- Using the Database (Making The database active to use)
 USE test;
 
 -- Deleting Database
 DROP DATABASE test;
