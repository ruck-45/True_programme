# USE Javascript In Jsx : 

    - We can use Js in Jsx by using : "{}"
    - Anything we write inside "{}" is treated as a Js code inside Jsx 

    - Example : 

        MemoItem.js : 

            function MemoItem(props){
                let priceClass = "MemoItemPrice"; -----------------> We set a variable "priceClass" which holds classes for second div inside MemoItemBox

                if (props.cost >= 0) { -------------------> We write a logic for "priceClass"
                    priceClass += " profit";
                } else {
                    priceClass += " loss";
                }

                return (
                    <div className="MemoItemBox" id = {props.id}>
                        <div className="MemoItemTitle">{props.title}</div>
                        <div className={priceClass}>  ---------------------> We pass the Js variable "priceClass" to className using "{}"
                            {32 + 78}  ----------------------> We also performed math inside the div' content using this feature
                        </div> 
                    </div>
                );
            }




# Props : 

    - props is how we generalize a component
    - In above example we have a component which can have the 
        - Desired ID
        - Modified ClassName (under circumstances)
        - Desired Title 

        etc.... That is passed to the component

    - we can use props to access the attributes passed to the component when it is called.


    - The way attributes are passed are the way we attach attribute to html tags 
    - All the attributes that are passed are stored inside the props object and we can access them using that in the function

    Example : passing attributes to components when calling them

        <MemoItem date = "November 20, 2020" title = "Paper Rolls" cost = {cost} ></MemoItem> 

                // date , title , cost are all passed here as attributes to MemoItem component
                // cost has been passed as a JS variable 
                // All of these attributes can be accessed like : props.date, props.title, props.cost


                // Then we can make as much MemoItem  just by calling a single Jsx code and passing some attributes
                // If number is big, try storing data in a JSON (in array of objects format) and then utilize it from there one by one
