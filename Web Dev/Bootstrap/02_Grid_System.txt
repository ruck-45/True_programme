Grid System : 

    Bootstrap's Grid system is based on following concepts:
        - Breakpoints
        - Container
        - Row
        - Column





Breakpoints: 

    These are ranges of screen width defined to make the webiste responsive.
    We can apply specific layouts/configurations to each specific breakpoints to change website how it looks in wide roster of devices.

    The metric used by breakpoints by bootstrap is : 

        Breakpoint          Class infix             Dimensions (Width)

        X-Small             -                       0 - 575 px
        Small               sm                      576 - 767 px
        Medium              md                      768 - 991 px
        Large               lg                      992 - 1199 px
        X-Large             xl                      1200 - 1399 px
        XX-Large            xxl                     >=1400 px





container : 

    It is a "class" defined by Bootstrap to make the contents inside the container Responsive
    Usually the whole website is wrapped inside a "div" of "container" class to make it responsive

    rows and columns are accessories used inside Container class to tune the responsive behaviour



row : 
    
    It is a "class" defined by Bootstrap that divides the "div" (in which it is attached to) into 12 equal parts
    Then we can define "col" inside it to form desired grids 

    Ex : 

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-3"></div>
            <div class="col-2"></div>
            <div class="col-7"></div>
        </div>

        --row 1-- --row 2-- --row 3--    --row 4-- --row 5--   --row 6-- --row 7-- --row 8-- --row 9-- --row 10-- --row 11-- --row 12--
        --col 1-- --col 1-- --col 1-- // --col 2-- --col 2-- //  --col 3-- --col 3-- --col 3-- --col 3-- --col 3-- --col 3-- --col 3--


    In above example row is divided into 12 equal parts.
    It has 3 columns who take up 3 , 2 , 7 parts respectively


col : 

    It is a "class" defined by Bootstrap that defines the parts occupied by the "div" inside a row
    If the sum of parts assigned exceeds 12 - It moves them below to adjust



Note : 
    A "col" should be DIRECTLY inside a "row".
    A "col" cannot be a child if "col", as "col" cannot be divided.
    To divide a "col", make a "row" inside the "col" and then divide it.

    Example : 

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-3"></div>
            <div class="col-2"></div>
            <div class="col-7"> 
                <div class="row"> // To divide the col-7 we made a row inside it (which makes it 12 parts)
                    <div class="col-6"></div>
                    <div class="col-6"></div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
