// We can attach jQuery in our website in two ways

    // 1. By downloading the jQuery file from its offical website
        // - We can download the jquery code from the official website
        // - It is available both in compressed and uncompressed version
        // - Generally better to attach the compressed version as it is smaller in size

        // - We can attach jQuery using script tag in head.



    // 2. By attaching CDN to our html
        // jQuery CDN is a link through which we can access jQuery file that is hosted in some other server
        // Google, Microsoft , jsDeliver and many more provide jQuery plugin and update to latest version as well

        // To use CDN just copy the script tag given and paste in head
        // It is recommended to use CDN whenever necessery to make website faster and also ensure less hit in our server



// Syntax

    // Syntax of jQuery is very simple
    // Syntax : $("selector").action();

        // selector : We can write any css selector combination in here, it works just like QueryAll selector of Js
        // action : these are special methods defined in jQuery to make som basic tasks available.
