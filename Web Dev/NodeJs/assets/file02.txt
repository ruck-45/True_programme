Robots, mechanical entities designed to perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously, have become integral to various aspects of modern life. Ranging from industrial robots streamlining manufacturing processes to robotic vacuum cleaners simplifying household chores, these machines exhibit diverse functionalities. With advancements in artificial intelligence, robots are increasingly capable of learning and adapting, making them valuable in fields like healthcare, exploration, and even customer service. However, the rise of robots also raises ethical questions about job displacement, privacy concerns, and the responsible use of autonomous technologies. As technology continues to evolve, the role of robots in society is likely to expand, presenting both opportunities and challenges for the future.
