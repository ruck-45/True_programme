// Data Exchange in the Web

    // Every exchange in the Web is an exchange of request and response
    // A client sends request to access a specific resource (webpage / data etc ..)
    // The server sends a message accordingly which is called a response


    // Servers are just computers that are maintained that the request-response service is available to us 24x7


// General structure of request and resopnse messages
